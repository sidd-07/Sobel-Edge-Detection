# üîç Sobel Edge Detection using Verilog on FPGA

## üßæ Introduction

This project implements the **Sobel Edge Detection** algorithm in Verilog HDL, targeting real-time image processing on FPGA platforms such as the **ZedBoard** and **Nexys-4**. The Sobel operator is used to detect edges by calculating the gradient magnitude of the image intensity in horizontal and vertical directions.
The design focuses on **hardware efficiency**, modularity, and scalability for embedded image processing applications. This setup is suitable for deployment in **FPGA-based vision systems**, with scope for expansion to live video streams using VDMA.

## üîÑ Methodology

1. **Grayscale Image Input**: The image is assumed to be grayscale, streamed pixel by pixel.
2. **Line Buffering**: The `lineBuffer` module stores three rows of pixels at a time.
3. **3x3 Window Formation**: A 3x3 kernel is dynamically created for each pixel using line buffers.
4. **Sobel Convolution**: The `conv1` module applies Gx and Gy masks and computes the edge magnitude.
5. **Control Logic**: `imageControl.v` manages the streaming process and asserts valid outputs.
6. **Integration**: `imageProcessTop.v` connects all functional blocks and prepares output.
7. **Simulation**: Run `tb.v` to simulate and verify the logic before FPGA synthesis.
